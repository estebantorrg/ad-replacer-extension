# Ad replacer extension
A chrome extension that allows the user to replace the ads with a single click with an easily customizable image (by default it's a dog).

# Main features 
Ad replacement (controlled by the user).
Simple, clean and intuitive UI with instant feedback about how many ads were replaced after clicking on the button.
Clean code focused on stability and UX.

# Technologies used
JavaScript (Event listeners, DOM (Document object model) manipulation and Chrome APIs (tested in thorium so it may work in most chromium based browsers) 
HTML5
CSS3

# Notes 
This project's first version was automatic but it replaced stuff without the user's consent and it had failures so i decided to redesign it prioritizing UX, stability and cleanliness, i learned that a good product not only consists in technical complexity but in giving the control to the user and making a clear and satisfactory interaction.
